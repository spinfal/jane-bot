# Jane open source Discord bot
An open source Discord bot made to help moderate and manage a friend's server.

This bot is not made to be used by other people. I am just simply making the code open source because I want to. If you wish to make a bot like this, check out [this repo](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template).

# How to setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Rename [config-example.json](config-example.json) to config.json & configure it
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` for prod or `npm run dev` for dev
